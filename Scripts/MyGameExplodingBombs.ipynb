    "I cant work out how to change the lightPosition variable from being the torch at lightAmount 500 to being the player_sprite at lightAmount 500 once the torch has been collected. I've included a flag for torch_collected in the on_update method, but this is not being picked up in the on_draw() function which is where it loads the shader. I've tried loading the shader in the on_update method instead but this has no effect - once the torch is picked up the light is still on the original position of the torch and never changes to the player. \n",
    "\n",
    "Did it!! Basically needed to make the torch_collected flag a global(?) variable by defining it a self.torch_collected in the init call, and then updating self.torch_collected=True in the on_update, which then passes it to the on_draw function as True and so can run the second part of the if statement to load the shader based on player position rather than torch position.
