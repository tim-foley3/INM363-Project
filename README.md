# INM363-Project
OpenGL shaders in Arcade

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub repository for exploring the impact that various lighting conditions has on a reinforcement learning agents ability to solve an environment.

In order to use the scripts, download a copy of this repository and install the library versions in requirements.txt.

For manual testing of game environments, these were run in Jupyter Notebook sessions (.ipynb scripts) and can be found in Scripts/LightEnvironment1_ManualRuns and Scripts/LightEnvironment2_ManualRuns.

To run the training algorithms using rllib, these were also done in Jupyter Notebook sessions and can be found in Scripts/Wrappers/PPO LightEnvWrapper Game 1 and Scripts/Wrappers/PPO LightEnvWrapper Game 2.
When running these in jupyter sessions, make sure the corresponding .py script and .glsl script is in the same folder as the .ipynb script you are running for the code to work without adjustments.

The scripts will also be able to be run as .py files if you want to manually convert them, and refer to the corresponding imported modules accordingly.

Results from the manual grid searches, amongst other various tests run, can be found in tests/.
